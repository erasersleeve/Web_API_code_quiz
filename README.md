# Web_API_code_quiz
This application runs a coding quiz using javascript. The content of this app is entirely created in java using the DOM. The "main page" the user interacts with is generated on page load, and when either the high scores button or the get started button are clicked the page changes accordingly. On the quiz page, a series of questions and answers are presented until the list of questions is empty or the user reduces the timer to 0. The timer starts at 80seconds and is reduced by 20 seconds for each wrong answer. When the quiz is over (either from success or failure), the user is presented with an input to add their names to the list of saved scores. The highscores page (available from the main and quiz pages) shows these saved scores and names.
